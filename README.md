Trvis CI builds and pushes new versions of the app when pushed to master branch. The app is a lambda function which is being executed by CloudWatch Events.

The infrastructure definition can be found in [main.tf](/deploy/main.tf). You need access to TKO-äly's AWS account and a configured aws-cli to deploy it.

Deployment:

1. Run `terraform plan` and review your changes.
2. Run `terraform apply` which deploys the infrastructure to AWS.
